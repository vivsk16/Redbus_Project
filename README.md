# Redbus_Project
Project: Redbus Data Scraping & Dynamic Filtering Application

Technologies used:
- Selenium for web scraping (extracting routes, bus details, handling pagination)
- Pandas for data manipulation and CSV creation
- MySQL (using mysql-connector-python) for storing bus details in a database
- Streamlit for building an interactive web app for filtering and displaying data

Key discussion points:
- Troubleshooting Selenium code (pagination, element click issues)
- Creating and saving CSV files (e.g., df_k.csv for routes)
- Converting data types and cleaning data (e.g., ratings conversion)
- MySQL connection issues (e.g., table/database creation, connection parameters)
- Building and debugging a Streamlit app (using streamlit_option_menu, handling image paths, filtering data based on user input)
- Virtual environment setup and package installations
